3) Architectural choices

-test 2x2 maxpool only instead of adapting to previous output (last row/column might be deleted but try anyway)
-test different optimizers
-test different hyperparameters for them (?)
-test more dropout and with higher p
-add more (conv) layers
-add more neurons in final dense layers
-add more regularization
-add data augmentation (rotation,flips,brightness,...)
